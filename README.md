# ML Zoomcamp Mid-Term Project: LBW-RiskPrediction

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a ML model to predict the risk of low weight at birth during the course of a pregnancy. 
Low birth weight (LBW) is a term used to describe newborn who weigh less than 2500g (5 pounds, 8 ounces). LBW can lead to serious health problems for 
babies and in developing countries it remain one of the leading indicators of infant mortality. Studies have identified several factors associated to LBW
including socio-economic context of parents, health history of the mother and medical care during preganancy. In Colombia, there is still an incidence of
over 10% of LBW in infants born each year. Therefore, this project aims to develop a tool that can serve to raise awareness about socioeconomic factors that
can lead to LBW and also predict risk during the course of a pregnancy.

## Dataset
The dataset selected for this project is the official record of all live births in Colombian territory during 2020. It is a dataset compiled by the 
Colombian National Department of Statistics DANE and available for download at: https://microdatos.dane.gov.co//catalog/732/get_microdata. All data is
extracted from the Certificate of Live Birth for the Civil Registry (*Certificado de Nacido Vivo Antecedente para el Registro Civil*) and encoded following
the instructions attached to the form available at: https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/catalog/732/related_materials.

As sugested in literature reviewed, the dataset was filtered to exclude any records with missing information. Multiple pregnancies were also excluded.
